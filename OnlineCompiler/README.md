> give code only in c++,,, sorry for this limitation didn't get the time to write the UI for language toggle switch
> do not provide any input or use input stream like scanf or cin as I am facing some problem
> Only programs written for output on console is supported hence no input is supprted here (Again sorry Not getting Enough time for this personal project)
> click on submit button to get the output (run button does not work)

Sample code :-

> #include <bits/stdc++.h>
> using namespace std; \n
> int main() { cout << "Hehehehsdfase "<< endl; return 0; }
